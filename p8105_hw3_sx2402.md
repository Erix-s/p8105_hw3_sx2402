## Problem 1:

``` r
instacart_skim = instacart |> 
  mutate(
    user_id = as.character(user_id),
    aisle_id = as.character(aisle_id),
    reordered = as.factor(reordered),
    order_id = as.character(order_id),
    product_id = as.character(product_id),
    department_id = as.character(department_id)
         )

names(instacart_skim)
skimr::skim(instacart_skim)
```

There are 1384617 observations from dataset `instacart` and 131,209
unique users. Each row represents a single product in a customer’s
order. There are in total 39123 unique product names. There are total 15
variables, 5 describing identifiers of order, aisle, product,
department, and user; and `add_to_cart_order` shows order in which each
product was added to cart.

Some other important variables include:

- `redordered`: if this product has been ordered by this user in the
  past
- `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
  n=nth)
- `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed
- `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was placed
- `days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA
  if order_number is 1

### Questions:

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?**

``` r

*There are 134 unique aisles and aisle `fresh vegetables` occurred
150609 times with the the most items ordered from*

**Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

``` r
aisle_counts = instacart |> 
  count(aisle, name = "n_times") |> 
  filter(n_times > 10000)

aisle_counts |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, -n_times)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_times)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
   viridis::scale_color_viridis()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, size=9, hjust=1, vjust=0.5))+
  labs(
    title = "Number of items ordered by aisle",

  )

**Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your

There are 47 ZIP codes observed 116 times and 26 fewer than 10 times.
The counties has little observation are relatively distinct and is
likely to be not rental or not residential so that not enough
observation and data can be collected through rental pricing. While the
zip codes observed every month are in majority of New York County and
Queens where rental is a general option and data is collected easity
with large amount of rental deals.

NYC rental prices have generally increased across all boroughs from 2015
to 2024, with a sharp drop in 2021 that aligns with the COVID-19 which
has impacted demand. After the pandemic, prices restored to original
place and continued to rise. Manhattan (New York County) consistently
has the highest rental levels and most available records zip codes,
while Brooklyn (Kings County) follows with moderately high prices.
Queens and the Bronx show lower but steadily increasing rents, and
Richmond (Staten Island) appears later in the data, after 2021, with
comparatively lower rental prices.

Manhattan (New York County) shows the highest average rental prices with
wide distribution with highest variation to 8000. Indicating both very
expensive priced max rental price and high minimum rental price among
all ZIP codes within the county. Brooklyn (Kings County) and Queens
follows, also with a narrower distribution generally lower than
Manhattan but higher than others. Richmond and the Bronx display lower
median rents and Richmond (Staten Island) has the narrowest
distribution, reflecting relatively limited variation due to little
sample.
